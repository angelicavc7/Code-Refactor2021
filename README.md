<Code-Refactor2021>
## Homework Task

Refactor existing code, by making it more accessible. By giving detatiled descriptions of titles, headers, sections, etc. The homework was created in order to not only make it more accessible, but also make it easier to understand and have a code that is long running. 

The problem was a lack of details, with little to no direction as to what was in the body. Doing this activity I was able to undrstand the importance of headers and labeling correctly, as well as a better understanding of css.style and how each section is linked and formatted.

## Table of Contents (Optional)
- (#installation)
- (#credits)

## Process
In order to begin the refactoring project:
-Created a repository and cloned it down to my computer, used git commands in order to upload document on to web.
-Placed develop folder from homework week 1 onto the my new repository
-used the code already in place inside the index.html and style.css to add to the code and create a more detailed document with clear description of what is in the body, by placing, titles, sections, and removing id's that already had a class placed.
-When finished upload once again onto github with the new additions.
-Create README.
